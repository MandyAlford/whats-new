## Set Up

Clone down this repo.  

run `npm install`.  

run `npm start`.  

Web application should now be available at `localhost:3000`.  
 
## Objectives

Implement React components in a web application. Learn how components interact with each other and understand the order of operations. Test all React class-based and function-based components. Apply snapshot testing and mock instance testing. 

## Challenges & Further Iterations

I would like to pull data down from a local url via a fetch request, and utilize a larger/surrent source of news articles as well as add additional styling for the desktop version of this application for a better UX.

Further iterations would include a responsive design, a mobile site, as well accessibility needs for all users.
